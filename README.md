# MERN - Simple Setup Check - Lesson 02

### Melissa Figueroa

#### What you need to run this code
1. Node (13.12.0)
2. NPM (6.14.4) or Yarn (1.22.4)
3. MongoDB (4.2.0)


####  Notes
This project was the best I could do after rereading textbook chapters several times and recreating my folder twice to make sure everything was in place.  I'm sorry that this is far from my best work and I hope to make far less mistakes next time.

####  How to Run
This project only works using ```yarn build``` followed by ```yarn start```.  The hot-loader is not capable of updating the page yet.  I will attempt working on the backend as soon as I fix and optimize the hot-loader.
